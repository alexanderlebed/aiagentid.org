# aiagentid.org — Global Registry of AI Agents

**A global identity standard for artificial agents.**

A framework for identity, responsibility, and interoperability between humans and autonomous artificial systems.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is **not** a model, a chatbot, or a tool.

An AI agent is a **semi-autonomous entity** that:

- acts on behalf of a human or organization  
- performs tasks in the digital or physical world  
- interacts with other agents and systems  
- makes decisions within delegated boundaries  
- accumulates history, reputation, and responsibility  

**An agent is not software.**  
**An agent is a participant in socio-technical reality.**

## The problem

We are rapidly entering a world where:

- millions of AI agents operate continuously  
- agents negotiate, recommend, transact, and decide  
- humans delegate real authority to artificial systems  
- agents act across platforms, services, and jurisdictions  

But today:

- agents have no persistent identity  
- no unified way to recognize the same agent across systems  
- no accountability layer  
- no standard of responsibility  
- no registry of existence  

As a result, agents are effectively **anonymous, interchangeable, disposable, and untraceable**.

We are creating autonomous actors without ontology, law, or memory.

## Why a global registry is needed

Human civilization required:

- names  
- identities  
- registries  
- signatures  
- reputation systems  

Without identity, there is no responsibility, no trust, no history, and no accountability.

AI agents are becoming actors in reality.  
**Actors require identity infrastructure.**

## What Agent ID proposes

Agent ID proposes a global, neutral standard for:

- identifying agents  
- referencing agents across systems  
- attributing actions to agents  
- linking agents to responsible humans or organizations  
- enabling continuity, traceability, and accountability  

This is **not a product**.  
This is **infrastructure for the next layer of reality**.

## Core principles

### Persistent identity
Each agent has a unique, persistent identifier:
