# Roadmap

This roadmap does not describe a product timeline.

It describes conceptual maturation stages of an identity infrastructure
for artificial agents.

Dates are intentionally omitted.
Progress is measured by clarity, not velocity.

---

## Phase 0 — Question Articulation (Completed)

Goal:
Formulate the problem space clearly enough that it cannot be ignored.

Status:
- Persistent agent identity defined as a missing layer
- Responsibility and delegation framed as core constraints
- Scope explicitly limited to identity, not behavior or ethics

Outcome:
A shared language for discussing AI agents as actors rather than tools.

---

## Phase 1 — Conceptual Stabilization (Current)

Goal:
Prevent premature solutioning while strengthening conceptual coherence.

Focus:
- Clarifying what an "agent" is and is not
- Distinguishing identity from implementation
- Stress-testing assumptions through critique
- Identifying boundary cases (legal, technical, social)

Deliverables:
- Public discussion via issues
- Minimal governance framework
- Conceptual examples (non-normative)

Non-Goals:
- No reference implementation
- No protocol specification
- No commercial positioning

---

## Phase 2 — Pre-Standard Exploration (Future)

Goal:
Explore whether a shared minimal standard is desirable and possible.

Focus:
- Identity syntax and persistence semantics
- Delegation and responsibility linkage models
- Interoperability constraints across platforms
- Compatibility with legal and regulatory frameworks

Possible Outputs:
- Draft specification (non-binding)
- Comparison with existing identity systems
- Academic or policy-oriented whitepaper

Participation:
- Researchers
- Infrastructure engineers
- Legal and governance experts

---

## Phase 3 — Institutional Pathfinding (Conditional)

Goal:
Determine appropriate long-term stewardship.

Exploration of:
- Working group formation
- Neutral foundation hosting
- Academic or standards-body affiliation

Constraints:
- No single-vendor ownership
- No platform lock-in
- No monetization of identity itself

This phase only proceeds if earlier phases demonstrate necessity.

---

## Phase 4 — Adoption Without Capture (Open)

Goal:
Allow usage without central control.

Principles:
- Voluntary adoption
- Forkability
- Backward compatibility
- Clear separation between identity and enforcement

Success is defined as:
The concept being useful even if this repository becomes irrelevant.

---

## Summary

This roadmap assumes that identity infrastructure emerges slowly,
through restraint rather than acceleration.

The objective is not to win a market,
but to make a missing layer legible enough
that others can responsibly build upon it.
