# Governance

aiagentid.org is a conceptual infrastructure project.

It is not owned by any corporation, platform, or vendor.
It is not a product roadmap.
It is not a monetized service.

This repository exists to explore, define, and stabilize
the concept of persistent identity and responsibility
for artificial agents.

## Current Status

- Stage: Conceptual / Pre-standard
- No formal implementation is mandated
- No exclusive control over usage or adoption

## Stewardship

The project is currently stewarded by its initiator:

Alexander Lebed

Stewardship at this stage means:
- maintaining conceptual coherence,
- curating discussions,
- preventing premature capture by commercial or ideological interests.

It does not imply ownership over future implementations.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- conceptual critique,
- alternative framings,
- edge-case analysis,
- governance and legal perspectives.

Code contributions are explicitly out of scope at this stage.

## Decision-Making

There is no voting mechanism at this stage.

Decisions about scope and direction are made conservatively,
with priority given to:
- ontological clarity,
- minimalism,
- interoperability,
- long-term responsibility.

## Future Governance

If and when the concept matures toward a formal standard,
governance may transition to:
- a working group,
- an academic consortium,
- or a neutral foundation.

No such transition is assumed or promised.

## Non-Goals

This project explicitly avoids:
- defining agent behavior,
- enforcing ethical frameworks,
- prescribing intelligence architectures,
- becoming a proprietary standard.

Its sole concern is identity as infrastructure.
