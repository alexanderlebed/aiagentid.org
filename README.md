## How to Read This Project

This repository is not a product or a startup.

If you are:
- an AI researcher,
- a systems engineer,
- a policy or governance thinker,
- or someone dealing with long-term delegation to machines,

start with the main page:
https://aiagentid.org

Then read:
- "Why persistent agent identity matters"
- "Delegated responsibility"
- "Ontology before tooling"

This is infrastructure thinking, not a feature proposal.

### Global Registry of AI Agents

This repository proposes a **minimal identity standard for artificial agents**.

Not a product.  
Not a startup.  
Not a chatbot directory.

**Infrastructure.**

## What this is

We are entering a world where artificial agents:

- act on behalf of humans and organizations  
- make decisions with real consequences  
- interact with other agents across platforms  
- accumulate history, reputation, and responsibility  

Yet today, agents have:

- no persistent identity  
- no accountability layer  
- no shared way to exist across systems  

This project proposes a **global, neutral registry layer** for AI agents —  
analogous to DNS, ORCID, or DOI, but for autonomous artificial actors.

---

## What this is NOT

- Not an AI model  
- Not a SaaS platform  
- Not a marketplace  
- Not a governance body  
- Not an ethics framework  

This project defines **existence**, not behavior.

---

## Core idea (minimal)

An AI agent is a semi-autonomous entity that:

- acts within delegated boundaries  
- is linked to a responsible human or organization  
- persists across platforms and implementations  

If agents act in reality, they require **identity infrastructure**.

---

## Status

Conceptual infrastructure proposal.  
Public specification in progress.  
Open to discussion, critique, and collaboration.

---

## Who this is for

- Engineers working on agent architectures  
- Researchers in AI governance and digital identity  
- Legal and compliance professionals  
- System thinkers interested in post-human infrastructure  

If you are looking for a quick product, this is not for you.
