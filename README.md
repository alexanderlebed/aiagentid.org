# aiagentid.org — Global Registry of AI Agents

**Defining the moment software becomes an agent — and what follows.**

A conceptual infrastructure proposal for persistent AI agent identity and delegated responsibility.

---

## What this is

aiagentid.org proposes a **minimal, neutral identity layer for AI agents**.

Not a product.  
Not a startup.  
Not a chatbot directory.

**Infrastructure.**

This project defines **existence**, not behavior.

---

## Why this matters

Software is crossing a threshold.

Some software no longer just executes instructions.
It:
- acts on behalf of humans and organizations
- makes decisions with real-world consequences
- interacts with other agents
- accumulates history, reputation, and risk

At this point, software becomes an **agent**.

Yet today, such agents have:
- no persistent identity
- no accountability layer
- no shared way to exist across systems

This is a structural gap.

If agents act in reality, **identity becomes infrastructure**.

---

## Core definition

An **AI agent** is a semi-autonomous entity that:
- operates within delegated boundaries
- is linked to a responsible human or organization
- persists across platforms and implementations

Without identity, there is no responsibility.  
Without responsibility, there is no trust.

---

## What this project proposes

A **global, neutral registry layer for AI agents**, analogous to:
- DNS for domains
- ORCID for researchers
- DOI for publications

But designed for **autonomous artificial actors**.

This layer does not govern behavior.
It enables **continuity, attribution, and responsibility**.

---

## What this is NOT

- Not an AI model
- Not a SaaS platform
- Not a marketplace
- Not a governance authority
- Not an ethics framework

This project does not decide *what agents should do*.
It defines **how agents exist as actors** in shared reality.

---

## Status

Conceptual infrastructure proposal.  
Public specification in progress.

This repository is in the **legitimation phase**.
Critical review is prioritized over implementation.

---

## Who this is for

- Engineers building agent architectures
- Researchers in AI governance and digital identity
- Legal and compliance professionals
- System thinkers working on long-term delegation to machines

If you are looking for a quick product, this is not for you.

---

## How to engage

Serious discussion and critique are welcome.

Please use **GitHub Issues** for:
- conceptual challenges
- specification discussion
- failure modes and edge cases

Low-effort comments will be ignored.
