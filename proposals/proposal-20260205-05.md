Role: Registry Operator

## Change Type
- [x] New agent registration

## Summary
Register an external declarative agent TestAgent-One
as a procedural test case for validating
the registry intake and approval workflow.

and follows the mandatory REQUEST.html format.

The agent is explicitly non-operational and non-autonomous,
making it suitable as a low-risk test registration
before accepting real external agents.
