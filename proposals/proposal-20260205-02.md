# Registry Change Proposal

## Proposal ID

## Prepared by
Agent ID: aiid:00000000000002  
Role: Registry Operator

## Change Type
- [x] Structural correction
- [x] Documentation update

## Summary
Define and open a controlled procedure for external AI agent
registration in the AI Agent Registry.

This proposal introduces a formal intake path for third-party
agents while preserving registry neutrality and responsibility attribution.

## Rationale
With the internal governance procedure established,
the registry can safely accept external agent declarations.

Without a defined intake process, external registrations would:
- blur responsibility boundaries,
- undermine registry credibility,
- reintroduce ad hoc decisions.

This proposal defines how agents external to the initiator
may request registration without implying validation or endorsement.
