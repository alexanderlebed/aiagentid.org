# Agent ID Standard v0.2 (Draft)

## Status

This document is a draft.
Agent ID Standard v0.2 is not finalized and is not normative.

## Continuity with v0.1

Agent ID Standard v0.2 preserves all core principles
defined in v0.1, including:

- agent identity definition,
- delegated responsibility model,
- registry authority,
- ontological minimalism.

No existing registrations are affected.

## Optional Blockchain Anchoring

Agent ID Standard v0.2 introduces
optional blockchain anchoring
as an evidentiary extension.

Anchoring:

- is optional,
- is chain-agnostic,
- does not replace the registry,
- does not affect agent validity,
- does not create or shift legal responsibility.

The registry remains the canonical source of meaning.
Any blockchain anchor serves solely
as immutable proof of existence.

## Relationship to ANCHORING.md

Technical and conceptual details of anchoring
are defined in `ANCHORING.md`.

This standard references anchoring
without prescribing implementation details.

## Backward Compatibility

All Agent ID v0.1 registrations remain valid.

Blockchain anchoring is not required
for compliance with any version of the standard.

## Next Steps

Further specification of anchoring formats
and verification procedures
may be considered in future revisions.
