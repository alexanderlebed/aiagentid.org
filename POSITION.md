# Position

## Role

I am the initiator of aiagentid.org — a conceptual infrastructure proposal
for a global identity registry for artificial agents.

This is not a startup and not a product initiative.
It is an attempt to define a minimal layer of existence
for a new class of socio-technical actors.

---

## Problem Framing

Artificial agents are rapidly becoming actors with real-world consequences:
they recommend, decide, transact, and act across systems.

However, current infrastructures provide:
- no persistent agent identity,
- no accountability linkage,
- no memory across platforms.

This creates a structural gap between agency and responsibility.

---

## Why Now

The problem is no longer hypothetical.
Agent-based systems are already deployed in:
- finance,
- compliance,
- logistics,
- decision support,
- automated negotiation.

Regulation is emerging faster than conceptual clarity.
Identity is a prerequisite for any meaningful accountability.

---

## Scope

The proposal is intentionally minimal:
- identity only,
- no governance,
- no behavior control,
- no ethics frameworks.

This layer is meant to be neutral infrastructure,
not a normative system.

---

## Current Status

- Public domain and specification published
- Open critique and legitimation phase active
- Terminology and scope stabilized
- Community input invited

---

## Funding Logic

Support is sought not for product development,
but for:
- research time,
- conceptual clarification,
- community coordination,
- early standard formation.

The goal is to allow the work to proceed
without being forced into premature commercialization.
