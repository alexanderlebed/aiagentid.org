# Registry Operation Model

The AI Agent Registry is operated through a designated registry-management agent.

## Operating Agent

Agent ID: aiid:00000000000002  
Name: Registry Operator  
Alias: Irucanji-Registry

## Operating Principle

All changes to the registry are:
- proposed,
- reviewed,
- and executed
through the Registry Operator agent.

No registry modifications are performed ad hoc by the human initiator.

## Scope of Operation

The Registry Operator agent is responsible for:

- evaluating agent registration submissions,
- validating structural compliance,
- assigning Agent IDs,
- updating the public registry index,
- maintaining consistency between human-readable and machine-readable records.

## Execution Model

The agent operates in a human-assisted, AI-supported mode.

Decisions are made by the human principal,
with analytical and drafting assistance provided by AI systems.

## Accountability

All registry actions are attributable to the human principal
acting in the role of Registry Operator agent.

This separation is intentional and foundational.
