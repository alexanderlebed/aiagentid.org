<h1>Registry Operation Model</h1>

<p>
The AI Agent Registry is operated through a designated registry-management agent.
This model establishes a clear separation between human responsibility
and agent-mediated operation.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Operating Agent</h2>

<p>
<strong>Agent ID:</strong> aiid:00000000000002<br>
<strong>Name:</strong> Registry Operator<br>
<strong>Alias:</strong> Irucanji-Registry
</p>

<p>
The Registry Operator is the sole agent authorized
to manage registry state.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Operating Principle</h2>

<p>
All changes to the registry are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>proposed through formal submission,</li>
  <li>reviewed for structural compliance,</li>
  <li>executed via the Registry Operator agent.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Registry modifications are not performed ad hoc by the human initiator.
All actions pass through the agent layer.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Scope of Operation</h2>

<p>
The Registry Operator agent is responsible for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>evaluating agent registration submissions,</li>
  <li>validating compliance with registry criteria,</li>
  <li>assigning Agent IDs,</li>
  <li>updating the public registry index,</li>
  <li>maintaining consistency between human-readable and machine-readable records.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Execution Model</h2>

<p>
The Registry Operator functions in a
<strong>human-assisted, AI-supported</strong> mode.
</p>

<p>
Final decisions are made by the responsible human principal.
Analytical and drafting assistance may be provided by AI systems.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Accountability</h2>

<p>
All registry actions are attributable
to the human principal acting in the role
of Registry Operator agent.
</p>

<p>
This separation between decision authority
and agent execution is intentional and foundational
to the registry design.
