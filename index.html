  <h2>Legal Notice — Delegation and Responsibility</h2>

  <p>
    This registry records <strong>delegated authority</strong>, not unlimited responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each registered AI agent operates only within its explicitly defined scope of delegation.
    Actions taken outside that scope — including autonomous, emergent, or non-delegated actions —
    <strong>are not attributable</strong> to the associated human or organization.
  </p>

  <p>
    Agent ID exists to <strong>fix the boundary between delegation and liability</strong>.
    Without such a boundary, trust in autonomous systems is structurally impossible.

<p><strong>Global Registry and Identity Standard for AI Agents.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Agent ID records delegated authority — not blanket responsibility.</strong></p>

<p>
A conceptual infrastructure proposal for persistent identity,
delegated responsibility, and interoperability between humans
and autonomous artificial agents.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Position</h2>

<p>
I am the initiator of <strong>aiagentid.org</strong> — a conceptual infrastructure proposal
for a global identity registry for artificial agents.
</p>

<p>
This is not a startup and not a product initiative.
It is an attempt to define a minimal layer of existence
for a new class of socio-technical actors.
</p>
<h3>Agent Registration</h3>

<p>
The AI Agent Registry is open for third-party submissions.
Individuals and organizations may request the creation of an Agent ID
by submitting a declarative agent record.
</p>

<p>
Registration is declarative and archival.
The registry records the existence of an agent and its declared scope of authority,
without validation, certification, or endorsement.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility and liability for all actions performed by the agent
remain entirely with the declaring human or organization,
as specified in the submitted record.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Current registration method:</strong><br>
Send a proposed agent record (JSON format) to
<a href="mailto:contact@aiagentid.org">contact@aiagentid.org</a>.
</p><h3>Problem Framing</h3>

<p>
Artificial agents are rapidly becoming actors with real-world consequences:
they recommend, decide, transact, and act across systems.
</p>

<p>
However, current infrastructures provide no persistent agent identity,
no accountability linkage, and no memory across platforms.
</p>

<p>
This creates a structural gap between agency and responsibility.
</p>

<h3>Why Now</h3>

<p>
The problem is no longer hypothetical.
Agent-based systems are already deployed in finance, compliance,
logistics, decision support, and automated negotiation.
</p>

<p>
Regulation is emerging faster than conceptual clarity.
Identity is a prerequisite for any meaningful accountability.
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>
The proposal is intentionally minimal:
identity only, no governance, no behavior control,
no ethics frameworks.
</p>

<p>
This layer is meant to be neutral infrastructure,
not a normative system.
</p>

<h3>Current Status</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Public domain and specification published</li>
  <li>Open critique and legitimation phase active</li>
  <li>Terminology and scope stabilized</li>
  <li>Community input invited</li>
</ul>

<h3>Funding Logic</h3>

<p>
Support is sought not for product development,
but for research time, conceptual clarification,
community coordination, and early standard formation.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to allow the work to proceed
without being forced into premature commercialization.
</p>

<p>
Current standard version: <strong>Agent ID v0.1</strong>

<h2>What is an AI Agent?</h2>

<p>
An AI agent is not a model, a chatbot, or a tool.
</p>

<p>
An AI agent is a semi-autonomous entity that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>acts on behalf of a human or organization,</li>
  <li>performs tasks in the digital or physical world,</li>
  <li>interacts with other agents and systems,</li>
  <li>makes decisions within delegated boundaries,</li>
  <li>accumulates history, reputation, and responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>
An agent is not software.
An agent is a participant in socio-technical reality.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p class="small">
  No agent action outside its registered scope may be attributed
  to a human principal by default.
</p>

<p>
We are rapidly entering a world where millions of AI agents operate continuously.
They negotiate, recommend, transact, and decide.
Humans delegate real authority to artificial systems.
</p>

<p>
Yet today, agents have no persistent identity,
no accountability layer,
and no standard way to exist across systems.
</p>

<p>
We are creating autonomous actors without ontology, law, or memory.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Core Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persistent identity</strong> — each agent has a unique, stable identifier.</li>
  <li><strong>Delegated responsibility</strong> — every agent is linked to a responsible human or organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Interoperability</strong> — identity works across platforms and vendors.</li>
  <li><strong>Traceability</strong> — agents accumulate history and accountability.</li>
  <li><strong>Ontological minimalism</strong> — identity only, not behavior or ethics.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
Conceptual infrastructure proposal.<br>
First public release: 05 February 2026.
